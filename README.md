# Extracting-analytics-info-from-the-Australian-private-data-store-sales-review-offering-liked-product


### In this project I will be extracting analytics information and evaluating sales data from the Australian private data store sales review that features top-selling products.


**The owner wants you to do some analysis on data with these criteria's:**


    **-calculate the total price average for all products**

    **-create a new price list that reduces the old prices by GHC5**

    **-calculate the total revenue generated from the products**

    **-calculate the average daily revenue generated from the products**

    **-based on the new prices, which products are less than GHC30**
    

**Below is the data you are to use for the problem :**


**products = ["Sankofa Foods", "Jamestown Coffee", "Bioko Chocolate", "Blue Skies Ice Cream", "Fair Afric Chocolate", "Kawa Moka Coffee", "Aphro Spirit", "Mensado Bissap", "Voltic"]**

**prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 45, 50, 35]**

**last_week = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2, 9]**
